                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This form of trauma therapy focuses on reprocessing traumatic memory, which helps us to feel less haunted by past experiences. This therapy is based on the insight that traumatic memory is stored differently in the brain than an everyday memory, and through eye movement and exposure to the memory via discussing it in a safe therapeutic setting, the memory can be reprocessed to feel less distressing and overwhelming.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This therapy is based on the insight that we all have many parts of ourselves, and these parts may have different or conflicting needs. Think about the anxious voice that might sometimes motivate you, but might sometimes cause you to freeze up or overthink things you need to do. This kind of therapy helps us to better understand our parts and where they originated in our lives, creating empathy and understanding for the self, which can help us to change and find alternative behavior better suited to our needs in the present.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This therapy is considered the 'gold standard' for OCD treatment, and I have seen it make huge changes for my patients. This therapy helps people with OCD resist compulsive behaviors and feel less distressed by obsessive thoughts.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This therapy focuses on helping us regulate overwhelming emotions. DBT blends mindfulness skills, communication skills, and some behavioral change to help people overcome patterns of feeling driven by emotions, and find balance in their relationships. This is the 'gold standard' treatment for people with diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, but I believe this therapy has something important to offer for almost everyone.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    I am certified in using mindfulness skills for managing chronic pain. These treatments help us to find relief in the face of physical pain. I believe that the mind and body are deeply connected, and the stress of our lives often shows up physically, through pain, illness, or other symptoms. These techniques can provide us mental and physical relief from pain, and help address the stresses which can contribute to physical symptoms.

                            I specialize in working with people who have experienced lifelong trauma, sometimes known as complex trauma or C-PTSD. This can look like folks who grew up in chaotic and violent families, people who were sexually abused as children, or people who were physically punished, emotionally abused, or grew up in unsafe environments. I also work with people who survived traumatic experiences when they were older, including survivors of abusive relationships, sexual assault, medical trauma, or other exposure of violence or traumatic incidents.

                            I particularly enjoy working with people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and people with a Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis. I am trained in Exposure and Response Prevention for OCD, and in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy for BPD. I love using these treatments because they are practical and skill based, and I have seen them make a tremendous difference to my patients.
